# SCS-Fishing

This project seeks to examine when and to what extent countries with unresolved maritime claims in the South China Sea transgress each otherâ€™s idealized exclusive economic zones (EEZ).  Specifically, the EEZs and fishing activities of China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, and Brunei are analyzed.  With fisheries in severe decline in the South China Sea due to overfishing, competition for this critical yet dwindling resource is heating up and shaping the geopolitical landscape, leading to heightened tensions and folding into a broader international debate over maritime territorial claims.

## Data

GIS data are available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-2r4dAfpx_9gHqK_8V9V89WFnoLzsi3y?usp=sharing

Fishing data were obtained from (https://www.globalfishingwatch.org)[Global Fishing Watch]'s ```Fishing Effort``` dataset.  Data are available freely but require account access and user agreement/license acknowledgement, hence why I will not provide the data here.
